## Problem

There is a square of 500x500 cells, and each cell has an integer.  This problem is to find the sum of all subrectangles that sum to a number divisible by â€‹13.

## Solution

Let n be the size of 1 side of the square. We can solve this problem in O(n^4) time and O(n^2) space by using the cumulative sum of 2-dimensional array.
