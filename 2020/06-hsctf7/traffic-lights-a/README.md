## Problem

See [Traffic_Lights_A.pdf](Traffic_Lights_A.pdf).

## Solution

This problem can be reduced to minimum-cost flow problem by a typical conversion.

Sample 1:

This sample is converted as follows:

![](graph2.png)

This conversion is as follows:

- Each I is regarded as the cost of the edge.
- Each F is regarded as the capacity of the edge.
- Node s and t are added.
- Edges from s to nodes whose value P exists are added where the cost is 0 and the capacity is P of the ending node.
- Edges from nodes whose value C exists to t are added where the cost is 0 and the capacity is C of the starting node.

Then, this is minimum-cost flow problem from s to t where the flow is Î£C (= 1+2+2). Various algorithms are known for solving this problem, e.g. primal-dual algorithm and network simplex algorithm. To cut corners in implementation, I used [NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io/).
